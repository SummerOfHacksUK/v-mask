# v-mask
# An open-source project to predict, prevent and combat on-the-go climate change effects related to air quality, pandemic or viruses outbreaks and pollution in high density places.
For the above mentioned our vision is to create a personal deveice which is connected to the cloud and interneconnected with real-time data from weather stations, environment sensing stations and other IoT plaforms to provide on-the-go location based air quality assesment.

For this to happen, we are aiming to use data from 1 micron IR sensors to model prectiors and increase safety.
These sensors are pocket size with a battery and can asses air quality based on location.

We aim to mount these senors on PPE masks and to prevent and remove
 - VOCs (often in cities are relseased by cars)
 - PM1 - 100 (dust particles most common are PM2.5 and above)
 - Bacteria / Pollen - most ofen related to allergies

# Use 3 types of filters. 
 - a synthetic anti-bacterial particulate filter like HEPA h14 or ULPA
 - a basic activated carbon filter from coal and coconut activated charcoal with a rate of 1 part coal 2 parts coconut to help remove NOx and VOCs
 - a non-woven organic cotton filter as a control barrier.  
 
 For maintenance: 
 - 1 micron filter is washed * synthetic material is reused 
 - The activated carbon filter is worn out and replaced. 
 - Discard the cotton filter and replace it.  
 
 Disinfect the mask with 5% dilute chlorine or alcohol after use or store it in an airtight bag.  
 Mask structure according to porous density. 
 
 Active coal: 
 - Macropores diameter 0.05 microns 
 - Mesopore 0.002-0.05 micron diameter 
 - Micropores 0.002 micron diameter  
 - 1 micron filter: For 1 micron  
 - Organic cotton: Pores ~ 20 microns similar to Whatman paper 
 
 Careful:  Individual HEPA filters or any other filter does not guarantee protection. 
 As an individual HEPA filter to work, they need either density - a tidal spiral or a thickness of 0.4-1mm to produce a diffusion effect of particles and catch the small ones.  An ideal filter is another feature and what matters is how it reacts chemically or electrostatically, some viruses are attracted to other materials or repel others.   The combination of cotton - activated charcoal - if filtered micro helps blockage.
